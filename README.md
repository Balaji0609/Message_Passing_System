# Message_Passing_System
We created a non preemptive OS scheduler using MPI library.


Developed routines for implementing non-preemptive OS scheduler for a multithreading environment. Developed a client server application with send and receive distributed message passing system. Built the system using semaphores, monitors, mutexes implementing the reader’s-writer’s problem.
